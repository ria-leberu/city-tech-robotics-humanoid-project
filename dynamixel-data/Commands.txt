************************************************************
Bioloid Command Set (to the best of my knowledge)
************************************************************

There are four different command modes.  

Executive (my name for it) 
Manage
Progam
Run

Any of the four command modes can be entered from startup mode; that is when the mode LEDs are flashing.  This is the mode the controller enters after you press the power switch or the mode (reset) button.  Three of the modes, Manage, Program and Run can be selected manually using the mode button followed by the start button.  To enter one of the command modes programmatically you must first connect to the controller using a terminal emulator (like RoboPlus Terminal) at 56Kb with 8N1 encoding.  Once in startup mode (LEDs flashing) enter the lowercase character v at the terminal.  This enables "verbose" communications with the user (again my name for it).  Now select the command mode by typing one of the four uppercase characters listed below.  Once you have entered the selected mode you will receive the appropriate command prompt.  The mode selection characters and command prompts are as follows: 

N	Program mode	]
T	Run mode		%
E 	Executive mode	{[ME]}
M	Manage mode		{[nnn:]}		(where nnn is the current CID)

Program mode starts the onboard motion editor function for the controller.  The onboard editor is very primitive and has been largely superceded by RoboPlus Motion.  The command language for this function is already documented by Robotis in some of their older manuals.

Run mode just runs the current BCP program on the controller.

Executive mode is used primarily by RoboPlus Motion.  The command list and brief descriptions are:

LIST		return list of motion pages
PLAY		play a motion page in flash
RPLAY		play the motion page in RAM
GET		return servo goal position
SET		set servo goal position
ON		turn on servo torque
OFF		turn off servo torque
OGET		return servo offsets
OSET		set servo offsets
UPLOAD	return motion data 
DOWNLOAD	transmit motion data to flash
RDOWNLOAD	transmit a motion page to RAM
GO		set goal positions for all 26 servos at once
SCAN		PING devices on the  dynamixel bus
EXIT		return to startup mode

Manage mode has the most commands only a few of which have ever been documented.  Beware that some of these commands can be quite destructive.  The current CID (control ID) is set using the CID command and its value appears in the manage mode command prompt.  Other manage mode commands like PING and READ use the CID as the command target.  CID 200 is reserved for the controller itself.  You should think carefully before using the DEMO, TEST or ID commands on any assembled robot!!!  That said, here is the command list along with a brief description of each.  

CID		change the control ID
READ		read data from control table
RD		same as READ
R		same as READ
WRITE		write data to control table
WR		same as WRITE
W		same as WRITE
SYNC_WR	issue SYNC_WRITE command
SWR		same as SYNC_WRITE
REG_WR	write registered data to control table
ACTION	activate registered write function
ACT		same as above
DUMP		display entire control table
D		same as DUMP
GO		move servo to position at selected speed
G		same as GO
HEX		display and accept data in hexadecimal
DEC		display and accept data in decimal
RESET		issue servo reset command
DRESET	issue servo digital reset command
PING		issue PING command
SCAN		scan dynamixel bus with PING commands
SEARCH	scan dynamixel bus at all speeds using PING commands
LED		toggle dynamixel LEDs one at a time
BAUD		set dynamixel baud rate
RUN		single step through BCP program with trace active
MONITOR	trace dynamixel commands and responses
CHK		continuously read selected control table entry (ESC to exit) 
TOSS		enters TOSS mode (passthrough mode)
T		same as TOSS
H		pass hexadecimal data directly to dynamixel bus
HELP		display help messages
RETURN	return from MONITOR mode
RET		same as RETURN
EXIT		exit to startup mode

Stay away from these commands!!!

ID		change the ID of all attached dynamixels
DEMO		moves the attached dynamixels around
TEST		similar to DEMO command
CALC		calculate the calibration centering offset (System Data 2)
CALD		set down calibration to the current position
CALU		set up calibration to the current position
